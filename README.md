# Sky.Class.js
This is a simple single inheritance javascript framework
# Usage
It's really simple to use it, just add the Sky.Class.js file reference, and then use it like:<br />

var cls = new Class();<br />
var cls = new Class(parent, mixins);<br />
var cls = Class.extend();<br />
var cls = Class.extend(parent, mixins);<br />
if parent is a function, it will be regarded as the parent class the the new cls generated
